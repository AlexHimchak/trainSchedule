### Overview

In this project we create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Instructions

* The app has these basic specs:
  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    * Train Name
    * Destination 
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  * Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
  * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
